# Exercises

Each exercise contains a short problem and a location for your solution.

- `exercise-01-golden.md` — implement a small CLI that computes the golden proportion.
- `exercise-02-ownership.md` — small tasks to practice moving and borrowing.

Run tests with `cargo test` to check some automated verifications.
