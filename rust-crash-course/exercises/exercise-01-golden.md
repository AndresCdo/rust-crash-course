# Exercise 01 — Golden CLI

Build a small CLI that accepts a number as the first argument and prints
its golden proportion (value * φ). Requirements:

- Parse the first CLI argument as `f64`, default to `2.0`.
- Print a friendly message with the input and result.

Place your solution in `solutions/solution-01-golden.rs` or implement as
an example under `examples/` and run with `cargo run --example <name>`.
